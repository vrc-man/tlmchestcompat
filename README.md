## Features

### Info Scanner
- **Right-click maid**: Opens GUI panel showing UUID, HP, Armor, Toughness, Damage, all growth stats, and eat count.
- **Sneak+right-click maid (creative only)**: Boosts all growth stats by +9000 (applied to entity attributes, not just NBT).
- **Right-click air**: Opens HUD configuration screen.
- **Buttons in GUI**: HUD Settings, Copy UUID, Slot Lock config.
- **HUD Tracking**: Scanning a maid automatically tracks her on the HUD. Click the [Track] button in the GUI to toggle tracking.

### Backpack Storage Core
- Requires a **Sophisticated Backpack** in the maid's Curios **back** slot.
- **Auto-store**: Every 1 second, transfers items from maid's inventory into the backpack. Skips locked slots.
- **Auto-feed**: When the maid's hunger is low and no food is in inventory, extracts food from the backpack.
- **Filter**: No filter — stores all non-bauble items.
- **Backpack full fallback**: If the backpack is full and a Storage Marker is also bound, falls through to the container.

### Kill-Proof Charm (for maids)
- Uses TLM API `IMaidBauble.onDeath()` — intercepts at `die()` first line, returns `true` to block ALL death including `/kill`.
- `onTick()` heartbeat — restores health to max if somehow reduced to 0 or below.
- No `BYPASSES_INVULNERABILITY` check — blocks even custom/penetrating damage from modded weapons.
- **LivingHurtEvent** — cancels all damage directly (added layer).

### Effect Immune Charm
- Every tick, removes blindness (`BLINDNESS`), mining fatigue (`DIG_SLOWDOWN`), and slowness (`MOVEMENT_SLOWDOWN`).

### Storage Marker
- **Bind**: Sneak+right-click any container (chest, barrel, etc.) that has an inventory capability. Already bound? Unbinds.
- **Unbind**: Sneak+right-click the same container again, or sneak+right-click air.
- **Filter GUI**: Right-click air to open. 3x3 grid. Shift+click items to add/remove from whitelist/blacklist.
- **Auto-deposit**: Every 3 seconds, transfers items from maid's inventory into the bound container. Skips locked slots.
- **Auto-feed**: When hungry, extracts food from the container.
- **Item restock**: Pulls filtered items from the container when the maid has fewer than 4 in inventory (up to 16).
- **Event-driven pull**: Listens to `MaidRequestItemEvent` — when the maid's AI needs seeds, arrows, or other items, pulls them from the container on demand.
- **Backpack priority**: If Backpack Storage Core is also equipped, only activates when the backpack is full.

### Player Immortal Charm
- **LivingHurtEvent**: Cancels all damage to the player.
- Works in Curios charm, belt, or back slot, or held in main/off hand.
- Creative / Command only — no recipe.

### SopChestExtension (Wireless IO)
- Registers Sophisticated Backpacks/Core blocks as valid chest types for TLM's Wireless IO system using `@LittleMaidExtension` and `IChestType`.

### HUD Overlay
- **Always visible**: Shows TPS, FPS, real computer time, and config info even without a maid nearby.
- **When maid detected**: Shows the tracked or nearest maid's name, HP bar, armor value, and eat count.
- **Tracking**: Scans a maid with the Info Scanner → auto-tracks that maid. Toggle via [Track] button in the scanner GUI.
- **Configuration**: Right-click air with Info Scanner → HUD settings.
  - ON/OFF toggle
  - 5 position presets (Top-Left, Top-Center, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right)
  - Scale (0.5x ~ 2.0x)
  - Opacity (0% ~ 100%)
  - Update interval (3s ~ 600s)
  - X/Y offset (-200 ~ 200)

### Slot Locking
- Lock specific slots in the maid's 36-slot inventory to prevent them from being stored by Backpack Storage Core or Storage Marker.
- **Config**: Info Scanner GUI → [Slot] button → 6x6 grid → click to toggle lock.
- **Stored on**: The maid's `persistentData` (shared between both baubles).
- **Security**: Only the owner, creative mode players, or OP level 2+ can modify locks.
- **Not affected**: Wireless IO has its own independent slot locking.

### Commands (OP level 2)

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/maidadd <attr> <value> [uuid]` | Add attribute value to nearest/specified maid |
| `/maidaddslot <slotType> [count]` | Add permanent Curios slot (default 1) |
| `/maidaddslot <slotType> near <range> [count]` | Add slots to nearest maid within range |
| `/maidaddslot <slotType> <uuid> [count]` | Add slots to specified maid |

Supported attributes: `hp`, `armor`, `tough`, `dmg`, `speed`, `reach`, `dig`, `resist`, `explosion`, `thorns`, `crit`, `regen`

### Maid Priority Chain
```
Backpack Core + Backpack in back slot (highest priority)
  ↓ (backpack full / no backpack)
Storage Marker bound container
  ↓ (container full / no binding)
Items stay in maid inventory (TLM handles overflow)
```

### Maid AI Item Access
The mod listens to `MaidRequestItemEvent` — when the maid's AI needs items (seeds for farming, arrows for archery, etc.) and can't find them in inventory, the mod automatically pulls them from:
1. The Sophisticated Backpack in the back slot (if Backpack Storage Core is equipped)
2. The bound container (if Storage Marker is equipped)

Items are pulled on demand — no polling, no waste.
